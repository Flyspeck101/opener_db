*ALL* data comes from [Ivan(28283)â€™s Comprehensive Opener Database](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rwI5Uww5AygrF3QSBm0o6hqTG1X8P2cRsJaBjYFMzDg/pub).

Data is scraped from that site, parsed using [this script I threw together](https://github.com/swng/tetris-scripts/blob/main/parse_ivan_doc.js), into a `data.json` file. ISO timestamp of the scrape is included inside the file.

DB is in early days, is subject to updates and changes.
